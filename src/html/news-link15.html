					Livanta LLC announced that the firm has been recognized for its excellent digital communications products for patients, caregivers, and patient advocates. Livanta received three AVA Digital Awards in the 2021 international competition for marketing and communication professionals, including a Gold Award and two Honorable Mentions. <br><br>

					When COVID-19 began affecting people's everyday lives, Livanta used its e-journal, The Livanta Compass, to inform stakeholders about the global pandemic. Livanta also developed a short video for social media to educate the public about its role in supporting Medicare beneficiaries. These items were part of Livanta’s external messaging campaign during the early stages of the public health emergency. The COVID-19 messaging campaign earned a Gold Award from AVA Digital. AVA Digital also recognized Livanta with two Honorable Mentions for its weekly stakeholder e-journal, The Livanta Compass, and for its Medicare Helpline web video. <br><br>
					
					AVA Digital recognizes outstanding achievement by creative professionals involved in the concept, direction, design, and production of media that is part of the evolution of digital communication. Work ranges from audio and video productions to websites and social media sites that present interactive components such as video, animation, blogs, and podcasts, to other forms of user-generated digital communication. <br><br>
					
					“As a Medicare contractor, Livanta has a role in disseminating critical messages to a broad range of audiences,” said Executive Director Lance Coss. “We realize that communicating with our range of stakeholders requires a full understanding of the unique needs and preferences of each audience segment and we customize our approach based on an extensive audience analysis.” Mr. Coss added that during critical times such as a global pandemic, Livanta stands ready to use its website, social media platforms, and other channels to disseminate messages on behalf of Medicare and other customers. <br><br>
					
					AVA Digital Awards are sponsored and judged by the Association of Marketing and Communication Professionals (AMCP). The international organization consists of several thousand production, marketing, communication, advertising, public relations, and freelance professionals. AMCP administers recognition programs, judging and rewarding outstanding achievement and service to the profession. <br><br>
					
					As part of its mission, AMCP fosters and supports the efforts of creative professionals who contribute their unique talents to public service and charitable organizations. Judges are industry professionals who look for companies and individuals whose talent exceeds a high standard of excellence and whose work serves as a benchmark for the industry. Winners were selected from over 200 categories in Audio, Video, and Web-based production.
