					Livanta LLC ("Livanta") has announced that, for the third year in a row, the firm has been recognized internationally for excellence in developing communications products for Medicare beneficiaries, caregivers, and patient advocates. Livanta received three MarCom Awards in the 2022 competition for marketing and communication professionals, including MarCom's highest honor, a Platinum Award, for its rural outreach campaign. In last year's competition, Livanta also received recognition from MarCom, including Platinum and Gold awards, for its communications products. <br><br>
					<img class="news-link__img" src="img/news/news-inner/inner3.png" width="400" height="400" alt="">
					In conducting the rural outreach campaign, Livanta worked with an external vendor that maintains a network of digital display monitors in healthcare facilities. Through this collaboration, Livanta broadcast its 30-second Medicare Helpline video in waiting rooms and lobbies of primary care physician offices in rural communities in four states with high concentrations of rural populations: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. This video aired in patient waiting rooms during the fall months when Medicare beneficiaries typically visit their physicians for vaccinations and other scheduled appointments. <br><br>
					
					In creating the toolkit, Livanta considered the RAISE Family Caregiving Advisory Council's "Initial Report to Congress." That report notes that many individuals who provide care for a relative or other person may not self-identify as a caregiver and, therefore, may not be aware of available resources. The report noted that a lack of self-identification leads to inaccurate or incomplete research, making it hard for policymakers to understand caregivers' needs. <br><br>
					
					The video played more than 130,000 times in nearly 200 physician offices across dozens of rural communities. The estimated reach of the campaign, which spanned three months, was almost one million individuals, including patients and those who accompanied them to their doctor's visits. <br><br>
					
					<i>"It can be hard to find ways to reach Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas because of the barriers they face. The PatientPoint campaign was a unique approach to reach rural beneficiaries where they are and provide critical messaging about their Medicare rights," said Livanta Executive Director Lance Coss.</i> <br><br>
					
					MarCom also recognized Livanta with Gold Awards for its "#MyRoleCounts" social media toolkit for caregivers and a series of publications about health equity. <br><br>
					
					MarCom is one of the world's largest and most prestigious creative competitions. MarCom is Page 1 sponsored and judged by the Association of Marketing and Communication Professionals (AMCP), a 28-year-old international organization of several thousand creative professionals. <br><br>
					
					MarCom Awards recognize the outstanding achievement of professionals involved in producing marketing and communication materials and programs. Judges are industry professionals who look for companies and individuals whose talent exceeds a high standard of excellence and whose work serves as a benchmark for the industry.
