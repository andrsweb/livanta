Statistical approaches include randomization, stratification, clustering, and convenience sampling. The goal of statistical sampling is to minimize the margin of error in estimation while maintaining reasonable sample size.',

As modeling experts, the Livanta Team navigates Medicare claims, medical record review outcomes, and other administrative healthcare data with advanced statistical techniques to analyze the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of national and state healthcare systems and to assist government agencies achieve their goals. Our experience modeling healthcare data applies continuous and discrete dependent variables using quasi-experimental, cross-sectional, longitudinal, clustering, and hierarchical/multi-level approaches.',
