			Livanta’s Case Management System (LCMS), part of the Zuilder suite of products, is used for all software projects at Livanta.

			The system has configurable workflows to support case management activities, including intake and investigation workflows. These workflows incorporate Artificial Intelligence through IBM Watson to identify abuse allegations from an intake narrative. The system supports forms automation. These forms can include context-sensitive sections, in which additional parts of the form are presented based upon the answers to questions within the form.
