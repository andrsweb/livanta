					You have the option to place an anonymous in confidence or self-identified report and are encouraged to
					use the Safe Hotline Reporting system. Safe Hotline provides you with the following ways to make a
					report:
				</p>
				<ul class="ethics__list">
					<li class="ethics__item">
						You can type your report at <a href="https://safehotline.com" target="_blank">SAFEHOTLINE.COM</a>
					</li>
					<li class="ethics__item">
						You can also text or call to leave a voicemail at <a href="tel:18556627233">1 (855) 662-7233</a>
						using Company ID number <span>4417225357</span>. Your
						voicemail will be transcribed into text so that you can remain anonymous.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="section__text ">
					If you want to remain anonymous when making your report, <span>please do not leave any self-identifying
						information.</span> The status of your report can be checked by selecting the 'Report Status' option
					via any reporting method - text, voicemail or <a href="https://safehotline.com"
						target="_blank">SAFEHOTLINE.COM</a> website. To check the status and respond to any comments and/or
					questions made by Livanta, you will need the Company ID number (<span>4417225357</span>) and the Report
					Key number. After entering a new report, you will receive a Report Key number that identifies your
					report. The Report Key number <span>cannot be retrieved</span>, so you must take care to safeguard this
					number if you wish to know the status or to add new information to your report.
				</p>
				<p class="section__text">
					Employees also have the option to have two-way anonymous communication with their company. To opt into
					two-way communication, you will need to make your report at <a href="https://safehotline.com"
						target="_blank">SAFEHOTLINE.COM</a> and following the instructions listed in Step 1. Emails will
					flow between you and Livanta through Safe Hotline acting as the intermediary. Livanta will not know your
					name or email address unless you specifically provide it in the report or email/call/text contents. If
					you elect to have two-way communication, you should not use the Report Status feature. You should
					instead login to
					<a href="https://safehotline.com" target="_blank">SAFEHOTLINE.COM</a>, which will take you to the
					reporter Home Page where you can read and add new messages to your report.
				</p>
				<p class="section__text">
					Spanish-speaking employees will only be able to make a report by phone. Instructions in Spanish are
					provided with this option but not with the text or website options.
				</p>
				<p class="section__text">
	
					The ethics complaint phone and website reporting hotline are managed by a third party. Ethics complaints
					can include, but are not limited to, personnel not following policies and procedures, harassment, or
					rudeness.
				</p>
				<p class="section__text">
					<strong>
						If you wish to file a complaint about a Livanta notice of noncoverage discharge appeal decision or
						quality of care complaint decision that does not involve an ethical issue, please call the helpline
						that you used to create the original appeal or complaint (see <a href="https://livantaqio.com"
							target="_blank">https://livantaqio.com</a> for the appropriate help line number for appeals and
						complaints).
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="section__text">
					This ethics hotline is not a 911 or emergency line. In case of emergency, call 911 or the appropriate
					emergency number in your locality.
