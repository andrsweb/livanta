				<ul class="ethics__list">
					<li class="ethics__item">
						Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, except with respect to actions for equitable relief filed by Livanta LLC, which claim may be filed directly in a court of competent jurisdiction as provided above, any other dispute between the parties to this Agreement, whether arising in tort, contract, pursuant to a right under statute, rule or regulation, and including any claim that may be subject to a class action, shall be settled by binding arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”), and shall be held in the State of Maryland, United States.
					</li>
					<li class="ethics__item">
						Any dispute properly submitted for arbitration shall be referred to one arbitrator in an arbitration administered by the AAA, according to the following procedures: The party or parties submitting (“Submitting Party”) the intention to arbitrate (the “Submission”) shall nominate one arbitrator. If within 20 days of receipt of the Submission, the party or parties receiving the Submission (“Answering Party”) does not agree on such arbitrator, then the arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA in accordance with the Rules unless the parties can agree on an arbitrator. The parties agree that they shall consent to an expedited proceeding under the Rules, to the full extent the AAA can accommodate such a request. 
					</li>
					<li>
						The ruling of the arbitrator shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties hereto and any other person or entity with an interest in the matter, and the arbitrator shall have the authority to direct the parties to make payments, withdrawals and distributions with the results of arbitration.
					</li>
					<li>
						The arbitration provision set forth in this Agreement shall be a complete defense to any suit, action or other proceeding instituted in any court regarding any controversy or claim (except as provided for above for claims permitted to be filed directly in court, but including, without limitation, whether any controversy or claim is subject to arbitration) arising out of or relating to any said disputes to be arbitrated hereunder between the parties; provided, however, that (A) Livanta LLC may request a State of Maryland State Court or State of Maryland Federal District Court to provide interim injunctive relief in aid of arbitration hereunder or to prevent a violation of this Agreement pending arbitration hereunder (and any such request shall not be deemed a waiver of the obligations to arbitrate set forth in this Agreement), (B) any ruling on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered as a final judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction anywhere in the United States, including but not limited to in a State of Maryland State Court or State of Maryland Federal District Court (and each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such court for such purposes) and (C) application may be made by a party to any court of competent jurisdiction wherever situated for enforcement of any such final judgment and the entry of whatever orders are necessary for such enforcement. 
					</li>
					<li>
						In any proceeding with respect hereto, all direct, reasonable and out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including, without limitation, AAA administration fees, arbitrator fees, expert witness fees, and attorneys’ fees) incurred by the parties to the proceeding shall, at the conclusion of the proceeding, be paid by the party incurring the same; however, the arbitrator may award payment of all or any portion of any such fees and expenses to the prevailing party in arbitration, or on the basis of any obstreperous or excessive litigation tactics.
					</li>
					<li>
						The arbitrator shall have power to permit reasonable discovery using subpoenas and other regular procedures and the parties shall cooperate in such discovery and not unduly multiply the proceedings, make duplicative or unnecessary requests or otherwise cause undue expense.
